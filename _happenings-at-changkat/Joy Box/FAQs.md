Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------


**When and where can I drop off my gift box?**

You can drop them off between 1 November to 27 November 2022, during weekdays 9am to 6pm at Blk 285, #01-217, Tampines Street 22 Singapore 520285.

**I do not have sufficient details of my beneficiary from the email. How should I prepare the gift?**

We try our best to get as much details as we can to our gifters. However, some beneficiaries and the social service agencies we work with may not have shared in depth details, hence we are only able to provide basic information. If you will like some suggestion of gifts that may be of helpful to your beneficiary, feel free to write to us at [PA\_TampinesChangkatCC@pa.gov.sg](mailto:PA_TampinesChangkatCC@pa.gov.sg).

**I missed the registration period. Can I still sign up for Joy Box?**

Unfortunately, we will not be able to accommodate registrations after the closing date. You can follow us on Facebook or Instagram to be notified of subsequent upcoming Joy Box.
