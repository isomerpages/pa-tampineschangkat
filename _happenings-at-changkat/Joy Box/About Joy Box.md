<p>Joy Box is initiated by Tampines Changkat in 2020 to spread joy to those
around us who are less privileged. During festive seasons, we hope to spread
joy to our seniors, families and individuals, some of whom may be going
through a tough time. Over past few editions, we have delivered over 3,000
joy boxes.</p>
<p>The upcoming edition will be in December 2024. <a href="https://go.gov.sg/joybox24" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Sign up</a> your interest with us now.</p>
