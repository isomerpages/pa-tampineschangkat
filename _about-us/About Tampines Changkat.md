# **#HeartsTogether**


At **Tampines Changkat Community Club**, we are committed to creating a warm and welcoming environment where every resident feels connected, valued, and supported. Guided by our core value of **#HeartsTogether**, we strive to build a community grounded in care, inclusivity, and empathy.

Our dedicated team of **volunteers and staff** work tirelessly to deliver a wide range of initiatives designed to meet the evolving needs of our residents from social programmes and festive events to support schemes and wellness activities.

We believe that when we work hand in hand, we can shape a community that is not only caring, but also resilient and united.

As Tampines Changkat continues to grow, we invite you to join us on this meaningful journey to make our constituency not just a place to live, but a place to truly **belong**.
