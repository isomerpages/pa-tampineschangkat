# **#HeartsTogether**

At Tampines Changkat Community Club (CC), we're all about bringing people together and creating a close-knit, caring community. With our #Heartstogether spirit, we aim to make everyone feel welcome and supported, no matter where they come from.

Thanks to the efforts of our amazing volunteers, we host over 30 events every year, from festive celebrations to cultural activities that help us connect, learn from each other, and build lasting friendships. These moments are all about fostering empathy, understanding, and a sense of neighbourly love.

Weâ€™re proud to be a place where everyone in Tampines Changkat can come together, share experiences, and feel a true sense of belonging.
