# **#HeartsTogether**

At Tampines Changkat Community Club (CC), we are all about creating a warm, caring space where everyone feels connected. With the spirit of our #HeartsTogether, we strive to build a community that looks out for one another and fosters genuine care for our neighbours.

With the help of our dedicated volunteers, we organise over 30 events each year, including festive celebrations and cultural activities that bring us closer, encourage understanding, and nurture empathy. It is all about supporting each other, building stronger bonds, and celebrating the diverse people who call this place home.

We are proud to be a hub where care for the community thrives, helping everyone in Tampines Changkat feel valued, included, and truly at home.
