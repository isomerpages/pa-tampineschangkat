Tampines Changkat Community Club (CC) serves as a focal point for community engagement and activities in Tampines Changkat division. 
 
One of our main priorities is to promote social-cohesiveness and cultivate the culture of sharing care and love. With our team of volunteers, we hosts more than 30 events throughout the year, such as festive celebrations and cultural activities to promote mutual understanding between people with diverse backgrounds, foster empathy and neighbourliness. 

Today, we are proud that we play an essential role in bringing the community closer together through leveraging on the resources that we have to conduct various events and activities. In addition, we also create a strong sense of belonging for all who call Tampines Changkat home.
