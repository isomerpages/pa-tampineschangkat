Tampines Changkat Community Club (CC) serves as a focal point for community engagement and activities in Tampines Changkat division. 

Our team recognised the importance of our localised initiatives including Comcare Financial Assistance, Public Transport Voucher, CDC Voucher, 100=50 and others. In addition, we have put in great efforts to develop targeted programmes, such as Grocery Distribution, Joy Box and more, to support different vulnerable groups in the community.

We believe that there are many more things that we can do together, to uplift our community. We would like to invite you to join us in this heart-warming journey to co-create, collaborate and contribute to a better Tampines Changkat.
