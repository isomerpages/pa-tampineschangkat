**Mayor of North East District |**
**Adviser to Tampines GROs**

At Tampines Changkat, our team of staff and volunteers are motivated by our mission to build a strong and resilient community. To ensure that we cater range of activities and resources that support our residents effectively, our team has been actively listening to the ground sensing related to residentsâ€™ emerging needs.

Our team recognises the importance of having localised initiatives including Comcare Financial Assistance, Public Transport Voucher, CDC Voucher, 100=50 and others. Additionally, we have developed targeted programmes, such as Grocery Distribution, Joy Box and more, to support different vulnerable groups in the community.

There is much more we can do to build a more inclusive and caring community, and I would like to invite you to join us in this meaningful journey.
