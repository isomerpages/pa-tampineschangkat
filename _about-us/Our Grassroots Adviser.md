<img style="width:600px" src="/images/About%20Us/for%20website.jpg">

**Mr Desmond Choo,**
**Minister of State, Ministry of Defence,**
**Adviser to Tampines Changkat Grassroots Organisations**


At Tampines Changkat, we are driven by a shared mission to build a strong, caring, and resilient community. We remain committed to listening closely and understanding the evolving needs of our residents, so that we can serve you better.

We recognise that everyday challenges look different for different families. That is why we continue to provide a range of support schemes to ease daily living expenses, from national programmes such as ComCare Financial Assistance, Public Transport Vouchers and CDC Vouchers, to Tampines-specific initiatives like the 200=100 Scheme. Beyond these, we also run community-driven programmes such as Quarterly Grocery Distribution, Joy Box, Sunrise Smiles, Baju Kurung Drive and various outreach efforts, reaching out to those who may need a little extra help or encouragement.

While we have made meaningful progress, there is still much more we can do together. I warmly invite you to join us in this journey as we continue to build an inclusive, supportive, and connected Tampines Changkat for everyone.
