### Joy Box

Joy Box is initiated by Tampines Changkat in 2020 to spread joy to those around us who are less privileged. During festive seasons, we hope to spread joy to our seniors, families and individuals, some of whom may be going through a tough time. Over our past two editions, we have delivered over 1,700 joy boxes.

The fourth edition of Joy Box will be happening on 17 Dec 2022.
