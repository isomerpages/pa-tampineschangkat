Showing our appreciation for our Grassroots Leader, Mr Abdullah Abdul Rahman. Being a connector, Mr Abdullah sees value in taking time out of his busy schedule to set up Chinese New Year decorations along the corridor for his senior neighbours to spread the festive spirits. You may watch the TODAY's [interview](https://youtu.be/IXHRR72C7KQ) with our lovely Mr Abdullah. 

Are you feeling encouraged by his example? Simple acts of kindness can make a huge difference in someone's life, and volunteering is a great way to make a positive impact in your community. 

Hesistate no more, [volunteer](https://form.gov.sg/63e61a35b1cf750011109bd7) now to join Mr Abdullah in his kindness movement!
