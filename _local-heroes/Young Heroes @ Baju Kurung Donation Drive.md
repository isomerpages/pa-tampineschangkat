There's something truly special about volunteers who go out of their way to make the Tampines Changkat a better place to stay in. 

Here, we would like to shine light upon three volunteers: Ms Wani Sulaiman, Mr Aloysius Yu and Mr Mohamad Irfan. They are part of the volunteer team who assisted us in making Baju Kurong Donation Drive successful! 

Together, we can all have the power to make a difference in the community. From packing of clothes to delivering of grocery packs, at Tampines Changkat we empower our volunteers to spread positivity and kindness in the way that you are comfortable in. Let's take a cue from the three young volunteers and join as [volunteer](https://form.gov.sg/63e61a35b1cf750011109bd7) now!
